==== Cream / Threader ================================================
======================================================================
Cream verifies the assertion-safety or termination for C programs. 
It implements Owicki-Gries and rely-guarantee methods for the
*compositional* verification of multi-threaded programs. Our tool
computes the requisite auxiliary assertions automatically using an
abstraction and refinement procedure. Our procedure is based on a Horn
clause encoding of refinement queries and facilitates the discovery of
thread-modular proofs when such proofs exist.


======================================================================
==== Requirements ====================================================
======================================================================
- Platform: x86 / Linux.
- C compiler: GCC.
- Other model checkers: Blast, ARMC (optional).


======================================================================
==== Installation ====================================================
======================================================================
tar -xvzf cream.tgz
cd cream
# add the bin directory to path
export PATH=`pwd`/bin:$PATH


======================================================================
=== Short Tutorial ===================================================
======================================================================
1. Run one example:
cream --threads thr1:thr2 c_tests/dekker.c

2. Change the C file to violate the mutual exclusion property:
cream --threads thr1:thr2 c_tests/dekker.c

3. Try other options:
cream --help

4. Run a group of examples and inspect output.log:
run_tests.sh -block rely-guarantee
run_tests.sh -block owicki-gries
run_tests.sh -block monolithic
run_tests.sh -block termination

5. Try to verify a C example using other model checkers. Scripts 
for Blast and ARMC are included:
cd blast_tests
./run_blast_foci dekker.c
./run_armc dekker.c

6. Please be patient, verifying multi-threaded programs is difficult.
If your tool can verify these C programs faster, please email us.
