    2. create a directory, suppose this is called  /workspace

    3. extract the entire package contents in  /workspace
    
    4. set execution (+x) permissions for  new-feeder.py, new.py

    5. copy or sym-link the CBMC binary file in  /workspace/cbmc,
       and all the other tools anywhere in the default search path.



* Usage: verification *

To try Lazy-CSeq, please use the following command:

    ./new-feeder.py  -i lazy_unsafe.c  -u1 -r1 -bcbmc

where the four parameters indicate, respectively, the input file to verify,
the loop unwind bound, the round bound, and the back-end to use for verification.

For a full list of options, please invoke the tool with the  --help  option.
